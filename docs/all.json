The algorithm can be used to perform a similarity search\nbetween words. For example, it is possible in a name list to find entries\nlike \"Meier\" under different spellings such as \"Maier\", \"Mayer\", or \"Mayr\".\nThe Cologne phonetics is related to the well known Soundex\nphoneticalgorithm but is optimized to match the German language.\n\n[de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kölner_Phonetik](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kölner_Phonetik)\n\nCopyright © 2018 Edwin Buehler.
